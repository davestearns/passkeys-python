# Passkey Authentication in Python

This repo contains example code for how to do
[passkey authentication](https://fidoalliance.org/passkeys/) in a Python API
server. To learn more about Passkeys, see my
[Authenticated Sessions](https://davestearns.github.io/tutorials/authentication.html)
tutorial.

## Running the Demo Locally

The server is written in [Python](https://realpython.com/installing-python/), so
make sure you have a moderately recent Python interpreter installed on your
machine.

Dependencies are managed using the wonderful
[`uv` utility](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/#installation). Make sure you have that
installed as well.

Clone the repo to your local development machine, and in the repo directory, run
`uv sync` to install all the dependencies.

Run the following command within the repo directory to create a self-signed
HTTPS certificate and private key for the domain `localhost`. This is necessary
to run the server with HTTPS support, which is required for Secure cookies _even
when running on localhost_.

```bash
openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:4096 -nodes \
  -keyout key.pem -out cert.pem -days 365 \
  -subj "/CN=localhost"
```

Start the server using this command:

```bash
uvicorn src.main:app --ssl-keyfile key.pem --ssl-certfile cert.pem
```

In your browser, navigate to <https://localhost:8000>. The page that is returned
should show a random email address with `Sign Up`, `Sign In`, and `Who Am I?`
buttons.

- Click `Sign Up` to create an account for the displayed email and register a
  new passkey for it. Currently this doesn't start a new session, so you need to
  sign-in next.
- Click `Sign In` to authenticate using that new passkey and start an
  authenticated session, dropping a Secure HttpOnly session token cookie.
- Click `Who Am I?` to `GET /accounts/me`, which requires the session token
  cookie, and will send back details about the current account if the token is
  valid.

The client-side JavaScript has limited error handling, so you might want to open
the developer tools console so you can see any errors. The script also logs the
various responses it gets back from the APIs.

## WebAuthn Libraries

The Python server uses the official
[webauthn library for Python](https://github.com/duo-labs/py_webauthn) to
generate passkey registration/authentication options, and verify passkey
credentials. Sadly, this library isn't well documented, so hopefully this
example will provide some working code you can use as a reference.

The client page uses the
[simplewebauthn/browser](https://simplewebauthn.dev/docs/packages/browser)
library to handle the passkey options generated by the server library.
Apparently webauthn requires (suggests?) that binary data be encoded in
[Base64URL](https://base64.guru/standards/base64url), not normal Base64, when
returned from the server. Client-side JavaScript has built-in support for
decoding normal Base64 (the `atob()` function), but not Base64URL, so this
client library handles that for you.
